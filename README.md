1.The original AlexNet was modified to create an optimized version by reducing the number of filters, adding Batch Normalization, and using He Normal initialization for better training stability. Large fully connected layers and the Flatten layer were replaced with Global Average Pooling and a smaller dense layer to reduce parameters and overfitting. Padding was changed to preserve spatial dimensions, the number of output classes was reduced to suit a smaller dataset, and the model was compiled and tested. Overall, the optimized model is more efficient, faster to train, and better suited for modern CNN training.

2.
The code was simplified by using image_dataset_from_directory instead of manual data loading and ImageDataGenerator. Image preprocessing was moved into the model using a Rescaling layer. The CNN architecture was made simpler, the optimizer was changed to Adam, batch size was increased, and training epochs were reduced. Overall, the updated code is cleaner, more modern, and easier to maintain.
